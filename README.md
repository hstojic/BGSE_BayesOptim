## Organization of the repository

Description of the course and other administrative files can be found in **organisation** folder. However, you will probably care the most about the handouts, you can find these in **handouts** folder. As a rule I will give handout in **pdf** and **html** format - I recommend using html ones, they look nicer. These files are generated (usually) from R, using Rmarkdown package; you can find the source files in the **source** folder. Source files are usually better if you want to copy-paste some of the code, since these are text-files, without any formatting (unlike pdf or html). There is also **resources** folder where I might put useful things related to the classes - snippets of the code, articles etc. Folder **exercises** will contain problems sets.  


## License 

Finally, all the files you find in this folder comes with a license. LICENSE file describes in what ways you can use them further down the line, after the classes are over.
