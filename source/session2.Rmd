# The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem


## Formulation

\center
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figs/octopus.jpeg}

- A tuple $\langle \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R} \rangle$  
- $\mathcal{A}$ is a (stationary) set of $K$ actions/arms  
- $\mathcal{R}^a(r) = P[r|a]$ is an unknown probability distribution over rewards  
- At each step $t$ the agent selects an action $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$  
- The environment generates a reward $r_t \sim \mathcal{R}^{a_t}$  
- The goal is to maximise cumulative reward $\sum^t_{\tau=1} r_{\tau}$


<!-- 

- no state space, no transition function!

- No delayed rewards, credit assignment problem, agents gets a reward immediately
- Isolates EETO, with no function learning problem,
- step before CMAB that has FL problem, correlated arms
- No delayed rewards, credit assignment problem, agents gets a reward immediately

For optimizing hyperpars?
- as if you have locations/grid of hyperpar combinations, with each attempt you get some stochastic draw, you want to get at the best location in the grid
- actually, this would still be better than grid search, as you don't need to necessarily do a full cross-validation, much cheaper!

What is MAB good for?
- Alternative to AB testing, another way to do experiments  
- you want your users to spend as little time as possible in bad versions of the website/recommender system etc

-->

## Regret

. . . 

- The **action-value** is the mean reward for action $a$, $Q(a) = E[r|a]$  

. . . 

- The **optimal value** is $V^* = Q(a^*) = \textrm{max}_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q(a)$  

. . . 

- The **cumulative regret** is the total opportunity loss $L_t = E[\sum^t_{\tau=1} V^* - Q(a_{\tau})]$  

. . . 

- Regret can be expressed in terms of counts and gaps:  
    + The count $N_t(a)$ is expected number of selections for action $a$  
    + The gap $\Delta_a$ is the difference in value between action $a$ and optimal action $a^*$, $\Delta_a = V^* - Q(a)$  
    + The cumulative regret, stated differently: $$L_t = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} E[N_t(a)] (V^* - Q(a)) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} E[N_t(a)] \Delta_a$$  

<!-- 
- Maximising cumulative reward or minimising total regret?
    - there are subtle differences
    - can be made independent of scaling? some advantage?
    - nonparametric
    - fnc of gaps and counts
    - good algo ensures small N for large gaps
    - problem: gaps are not known!
 -->
----


## Random exploration approaches

- We consider algorithms that estimate $\hat{Q}_t(a) \approx Q(a)$, by tracking the means $$ \hat{Q}_t(a) = \frac{1}{N_t(a)} \sum^T_{t=1} r_t \mathbf{1}(a_t=a)$$ or $$ \hat{Q}_t(a) = \hat{Q}_{t-1}(a) + \alpha (r_t - \hat{Q}_{t-1}(a))$$

. . . 

- Three choice rules:  
    + **greedy**: $a_t^* = \textrm{argmax}_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \hat{Q}_t(a)$  
    + **$\epsilon$-greedy**: With probability $1 - \epsilon$ select $a_t^* = \textrm{argmax}_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \hat{Q}_t(a)$, with probability $\epsilon$ select a random action  
    + **Softmax**: $P(a_t=a)=\frac{\exp(\hat{Q}_t(a)/\tau )}{\sum_{a'=1}^{K}\exp(\hat{Q}_t(a')/\tau )}$
   
<!-- 

That is also called the learning rule
- you might have seen it in its online version


The greedy algorithm selects action with highest value
- Greedy can lock onto a suboptimal action forever
- Greedy has linear total regret

epsilon greedy 
- explores forever
- does not lock itself, but still linear regret

softmax
- does the same, if temperature parameter is fixed

-->
----


## Linear regret

\center
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/linearregret.png}

\source{\href{http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html}{David Silver lectures}}

<!-- 

why linear?
- greedy - usually selects suboptimal arm and then each choice will increase the regret linearly 
- epsilon greedy - lower slope, but still linear as it explores randomly with fixed probability, you always get some regret

is sublinear possible?
- decaying epsilon greedy
    - use counts - proxy for CI (UCB)
    - log asymptotic regret

there is a lower bound for mab
- we want to push the algos closer to that bound

-->
----


## Lower bound on regret
 
> - Asymptotic total regret is at least logarithmic in number of steps (Lai & Robbins, 1985) $$\textrm{lim}_{t \to \infty} \ge \textrm{log} t \sum_{a|\Delta_a > 0} \frac{\Delta_a}{KL(\mathcal{R}^a \parallel \mathcal{R}^{a^*})}$$

> - $\textrm{log} t$ is the important bit, the second term is a constant, roughly task difficulty    
>     + KL divergence says how similar the reward distributions of two arms are
>     + The difference in expected rewards between the arms is described by the gap, $\Delta_a$


<!-- 

KL divergence
- indicates the difficulty of the problem, similarity between the distributions
- Hard problems have similar-looking arms with different means

-->
----


## Optimism in the face of uncertainty

\center
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/posteriors.png}
\source{\href{http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html}{David Silver lectures}}

. . .

- any disadvantages?

<!-- 

Which action should we pick?
- The more uncertain we are about an action-value
- The more important it is to explore that action
- It could turn out to be the best action

Why is all this a heuristic?
- the title is a give away :)
- does not include effect of its own experience, no planning

Some of the issues:
- infinite action/state space - you explore all the time!
- in reality you would want some safe exploration

-->
----


## Optimistic initialization & $\epsilon_t$-greedy

- $\epsilon$-greedy with optimistic initialization 
    + Simple idea: initialise $\hat{Q}(a)$ to a high value  
    + Update rule: $$ \hat{Q}_t(a_t) = \hat{Q}_{t-1}(a) + \frac{1}{N_t(a_t)} (r_t - \hat{Q}_{t-1}(a))$$ 
    + Everything else stays the same!  

. . . 

- Decaying $\epsilon_t$-greedy (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Fischer, 2002)
    + Pick a decay schedule for $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$, ...
        * e.g. $\epsilon_t = \textrm{min} \{1, \frac{c|\mathcal{A}|}{\textrm{min}_a \Delta_a t}\}$
    + Has logarithmic asymptotic total regret (for known gaps)
    + In practice very good performance  
    + But difficult to tune the decay

<!-- 

What does opt initialization do?
- Encourages systematic exploration early on, proxy for everything is uncertain, has high informational value until you unlearn it
- But can still lock onto suboptimal action
- greedy + optimistic initialisation has linear total regret
- e-greedy + optimistic initialisation has linear total regret

Decaying $\epsilon$-greedy 
- sublinear! if we know the gaps it achieves lai Robbins log bound

Counts - 
- A distribution free proxy for how certain you are about your Q values  
- With UCB we see more why it is so
- very little prior knowledge! no need to assume a distribution

-->

----


## Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB)

> - The main principle
>     - Estimate an upper confidence $\hat{U}_t(a)$ for each action value, such that $Q(a) \le \hat{Q}_t(a) + \hat{U}_t(a)$ with high probability
>     - Select action maximising Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) $$a_t = \textrm{argmax}  \hat{Q}_t(a) + \hat{U}_t(a)$$  

> - UCB1 algorithm (Auer et al, 2002) $$a_t = \textrm{argmax}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  Q(a) + \sqrt{\frac{2 \textrm{log} t}{N_t(a)}}$$

> - Easily converted to a probabilistic version

<!-- 

Counts - 
- A distribution free proxy for how certain you are about your Q values  
- With UCB we see more why it is so
- very little prior knowledge! no need to assume a distribution

This depends on the number of times N(a) has been selected
- Small N t (a) ⇒ large Û t (a) (estimated value is uncertain)
- Large N t (a) ⇒ small Û t (a) (estimated value is accurate)
- if you stop choosing it, uncertainty terms increases, but more slowly

Assumes...
- t goes to infinity
- nothing to tune 
- no assumptions, works for any distribution
- so originally a frequentist version, but we can have a probabilistic model that estimates the uncertainty directly, not using counts etc  
    - not necessarily good, wrong prior can hurt...
-->
----


## UCB1 derivation

> - Hoeffding's Inequality
>     + Let $X_1,..., X_t$ be IID random variables in $[0,1]$, and let $\bar{X}_t = \frac{1}{t} \sum^t_{\tau=1} X_{\tau}$ be the sample mean. Then  $$P[E[X] > \bar{X}_t + u] \le e^{-2tu^2}$$

> - When applied to bandit setting, conditioned on arm $a$, $P[Q(a) > \hat{Q}_t(a) + U_t(a)] \le e^{-2N_t(a)U_t(a)^2}$ 

> - Solving for $U_t(a)$, $U_t(a) = \sqrt{\frac{-\textrm{log} p}{2N_t(a)}}$
>     - As $t \to \infty$ we want a tendency to select the optimal action, so we reduce $p$ as a function of time, e.g. $p = t^{-4}$
>     - We arrive at $$U_t(a) = \sqrt{\frac{2 \textrm{log} t}{N_t(a)}}$$

<!-- 

there are various variants, whole family, using slightly different bounds
- Chernoffs, Azuma, ...

et-greedy does quite well in many scenarios, see Auer 2002

-->
----


## Bayesian bandits

. . . 

- So far we have made very few assumptions about the reward distribution $R$  

. . . 

- With Bayesian approach 
    + We can exploit our prior knowledge of rewards, $P[R]$
    + We get full posterior distributions of rewards $P[R|h_t]$

. . . 

- Use posterior instead of counts to guide exploration
    + Bayesian UCB, $a_t = \textrm{argmax} \mu_a + \beta \sigma_a$
    + Probability matching, selects action $a$ according to probability that $a$ is the optimal action, $$\pi(a|h_t) = P[Q(a) > Q(a'), \forall a' \neq a | h_t]$$


. . . 

- Wrong priors might cause issues.

<!-- 

Probability matching naturally trades off, probability that it is optimal reflects uncertainty as well!
- Difficult to compute for larger number of arms 
- But very easy to sample!

-->

----


## Parametric Bayesian approach: Beta-Bernoulli bandit

. . . 

> - A generic probabilistic model parametrized by $\mathbf{w}$, with $\mathcal{D}$ denoting the data
> - We can express our prior beliefs about the parameter values through $P[\mathbf{w}]$  
> - Posterior is then obtained by applying the Bayes rule, $$P[\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{D}] = \frac{P[\mathcal{D}|\mathbf{w}]P[\mathbf{w}]}{P[\mathcal{D}]}$$
> - Consider the MAB version where reward distribution of each arm follows Bernoulli distribution with unknown parameter $p \in (0,1)$ with rewards, $r \in {0,1}$   
> - Reward of each arm is determined by function $f$ that takes index of an arm $a \in 1,...,K$ and returns parameter $p_a$  
> - We can fully describe $f$ with parameter $\mathbf{w} \in (0,1)^K$ so that $f_{\mathbf{w}}(a)=w_a$  
> - Observations are collected in $\mathcal{D}_t = \{(a_{\tau}, r_{\tau})\}_{\tau}^t$ as a set of tuples, where $a_{\tau}$ identifies the arm and $r_{\tau}$ is the reward

<!-- 
Bernoulli bandit 
- K drugs and we wish to measure the efficacy of the tratiment (prob of a successful cure)  
- AB testing
-->
----


## Thompson Sampling for Beta-Bernoulli MAB problem

. . . 

- Classical choice for the prior is a conjugate to the Bernoulli likelihood, Beta distribution $$P[\mathbf{w}|\alpha,\beta] = \prod^K_{a=1} \textrm{Beta}(w_a|\alpha,\beta)$$

. . . 

- With such conjugate prior we can efficiently compute the posterior, $$P[\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{D}] = \prod^K_{a=1} \textrm{Beta}(w_a|\alpha + n_{,1}, \beta + n_{a,0})$$ 
    + $n_{,1}$ is a count of 1 outcomes whenever for arm $a$ 
    + $n_{a,0}$ is a count of 0 outcomes whenever for arm $a$ 

. . . 

- Thompson sampling (Thompson, 1933; Chapelle, Li, 2010)  
    + Sample $\mathbf{w}'$ from each posterior and then maximize, $$a_{t+1} = \textrm{argmax}_a f_{\mathbf{w}'}(a), \textrm{where } \mathbf{w}' \sim P[\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{D}_t]$$  
    + Thompson sampling achieves Lai and Robbins lower bound!  

<!-- 

\alpha,\beta - pseudocounts in Beta

Thompson 
- here it is possible to analytically compute the choice probabilities, for limited K  
- Also called posterior sampling

Parametric solution to MAB, importantly, uses the uncertainty

We could have written this without invoking function f, but wanted to parat

Benefits of the Thompson sampling
1. only the prior, No free parameters   
2. Naturally trading off exploration and exploitation - exploring only likely arms
3. very fast! can be important, e.g. in ad placement Criteo is having auctions and needs to serve things while the webpage loads, needs to respond in ms
4. great for batch updates and when rewards are a bit delayed - bcs it draws samples, its not going to take the same samples (a combo of decision noise and informational value)

Disadvantages 
- when sequence of steps, as in MDP, then due to its randomess that it adds in each step there is no consistency!

# Contextual Multi-armed Bandit (CMAB) problem


## Formulation

- A tuple $\langle \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{R} \rangle$  
- We introduce the state representation again
- $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of actions/arms  
- $\mathcal{S}=P[s]$ is an unknown distribution over
states (or "contexts") 
- $\mathcal{R}^a(r) = P[r|s,a]$ is an unknown probability distribution over rewards  

- At each step $t$ 
    + The environment generates state $s_t \sim \mathcal{S}$  
    + The agent selects an action $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$  
    + The environment generates a reward $r_t \sim \mathcal{R}_{s_t}^{a_t}$  

- The goal is to maximise cumulative reward $\sum^t_{\tau=1} r_{\tau}$

\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figs/yahoonews.png}


<!-- 
State could change or be different for each option 
- e.g. different users could have their own function/state, or there is a different function for each product
- for hyperparamter tuning things are simpler than that, we have a single reward function, single state
- however, use an agent will still have a probability distribution over possible states
-->

## Bayesian nonparametric approach: Gaussian Processes (GP)

- Inducing a Gaussian prior over functions: $$f(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(\mathbf{x}),k(\mathbf{x},  \mathbf{x}'))$$

- Here, $m(\mathbf{x})$ is a mean function modeling the expected output of the function and $k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')$ is a kernel function modeling the covariance between different points. $$m( \mathbf{x}) = E[f(\mathbf{x})]$$ and $$k(x,x') = E [(f( \mathbf{x})-m(x))(f( \mathbf{x'})-m(x'))]$$  
- The choice of an appropriate kernel is normally based on assumptions such as smoothness and likely patterns to be expected in the data.

----


## Gaussian Processes (GP)

. . . 

- Popular choice is the squared exponential (also called Gaussian or Radial Basis Function) kernel. $$k(x,x') =\sigma^2\exp\left(-\frac{(x-x')^2}{2\lambda^ 2}\right)$$

. . . 

- Correlation between two points decays according to a power function in dependency of the distance between the two points 
- Covariance is symmetric, that is that only the distance between two points matters, but not the direction. 

. . . 

- Good for smooth functions, hyperparameters $\lambda$ (called the length-scale) and $\sigma^2$ (the noise constant) are normally optimized by using the marginal likelihood.

----


## Gaussian Processes (GP)

- This implies the aforementioned distribution over functions as we can easily generate samples for new input points at location $X_\star$. $$\mathbf{f_\star} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, K\left(X_\star,X_\star)\right)$$

. . . 

- Given observations $\mathcal{D}=\{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}\}$ with a noise level $\sigma$, we can draw new predictions from our function $\mathbf{f}_\star$ for inputs $X_\star$ as described below.

\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
       \mathbf{y}         \\[0.3em]
       \mathbf{f}_\star 
     \end{bmatrix}
\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0}, 
 \begin{bmatrix}
K(X,X)+\sigma^2 I & K(X,X_\star)       \\[0.3em]
K(X_\star, X) & K(X_\star, X_\star)
     \end{bmatrix}
\right)
\end{align*}


----


## Gaussian Processes (GP)

- Treat a function as a vector of infinite size. 
- We can simply draw outputs for finite points by using a multivariate normal distribution with a covariance matrix generated by our kernel. 
- Calculating the expectation of the Gaussian Process at the new points is then
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{f}_\star|X,\mathbf{y},X_\star &\sim \mathcal{N}(\overline{\mathbf{f}}_\star, \text{cov}(\mathbf{f}_\star))
\end{align*}

- Predictions for new points are generated based on the expected mean value and covariance function of the posterior Gaussian Process. $$\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{f}_\star|X,\mathbf{y},X_\star]=K(X_\star,X)[K(X,X)+\sigma^2I]^{-1}\mathbf{y}$$$$\text{cov}(\mathbf{f}_\star)=K(X_\star,X_\star)-K(X_\star,X)[K(X,X)+\sigma^2I]^{-1}K(X,X_\star)$$

## Computational considerations and alternative regression models 

. . . 

- Although we have analytic expressions, exact inference in GP regression has a cost of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ 
- Due to inversion of the covariance matrix  
    + in practice using Cholesky decomposition reduces the cost to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$  
    + however, in BO we have to repeat it in every iteration as hyperparameters change  
- With large budgets the cost might be prohibitive 
    - Sparse GPs

. . . 

- Other alternative regression models? 
    + Random Forests (SMAC, TPE)  
    + Variance in predictions of the trees used as a proxy for uncertainty  
    + Poor extrapolators 
    + GPs are relatively bad as well, but they revert to prior far from the inputs, while RF is unrealistically confident

## GP-UCB


\center
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/GPUCB.png}

- Regret bounds, Srinivas et al (2010) 

- Expected improvement, Probability of improvement, Entropy search, predictive entropy search, Portfolios of acquisition functions (Hedge, Entropy search portfolio)

<!-- 
In portfolio multiple acq fncs propose potential queries and with some meta criterion we choose among them - acq fnc at a higher level
 -->
----


## Expected Improvement

- $EI(\textbf{x}) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \max \left\{0, f(\textbf{x}) - f(\hat{\textbf{x}}) \right\} \right],$ where $\hat{\textbf{x}}$ is the current optimal set of hyperparameters.  

. . .

- We can actually compute EI expectation under the GP model 
\begin{align}
EI(\textbf{x}) &= \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    (\mu(\textbf{x}) - f(\hat{\textbf{x}})) \Phi(Z) + \sigma(\textbf{x})\phi(Z) & \text{if $\sigma(\textbf{x}) > 0$} \\
    0 & \text{if $\sigma(\textbf{x}) = 0$}
  \end{array}
  \right. \\
Z &= \frac{\mu(\textbf{x}) - f(\hat{\textbf{x}})}{\sigma(\textbf{x})}
\end{align} 

where $\Phi(z)$, and $\phi(z)$, are the cumulative distribution and probability density function of the (multivariate) standard normal distribution.

. . .

1. EI is high when the (posterior) expected value $\mu(\textbf{x})$ is higher than the current best value $f(\hat{\textbf{x}})$; or
2. EI is high when the uncertainty $\sigma(\textbf{x})$ around the point $\textbf{x}$ is high.

<!-- 

Intuitively, this makes sense. If we maximize the expected improvement, we will either sample from points for which we expect a higher value of $f$
, or points in a region of $f$ we haven’t explored yet ($\sigma(\textbf{x})$ is high). In other words, it trades off exploitation versus exploration.

>     + Discretization and grid search (e.g. Snoek et al 2012)  
>     + Adaptive grids (Badernet, Kegl, 2010)

>     + Difficult to asses the performance and there are few theoretical guarantees  

> - Recent development: Optimistic optimization 
>     + Use the same optimism in the face of uncertainty on acquisition function optimization level as well

> - GP with ARD would typically have $D+3$ hyperparameters: $D$ length scales, constant mean, noise variance $\sigma_n^2$ and signal variance $\sigma_f^2$  
> - Instead of obtaining the point estimates of hyperparameters by optimizing the marginal likelihood, we should take into account uncertainty about GP's parameters when optimizing the acquisition function  
> - Feasible with some functions like EI and PI   

> - Integrated acquisition function $$\hat{a}(\mathbf{x}; {\mathbf{x}_t, y_t}) = \int a(\mathbf{x}; \{\mathbf{x}_t, y_t\}, \theta) P[\theta|\{\mathbf{x}_t, y_t\}^t]d\theta$$
> - Monte Carlo estimate, can be acquired efficiently with slice sampling (see Murray & Adams, 2010)

<!-- 

see Snoek pg 4 
- this is a correct generalization to account for uncertainty in hyperparameters

## Taking into account modeling costs

> - So far we have been concerned with finding good hyperparameters in fewest steps/evaluations possible  

> - Sometimes a better goal is to minimize duration, wallclock time, not the number of function evaluations  
> - Different combinations of hyperparameters can lead to very different evaluation times  

> - Snoek et al (2012): *expected improvement per second*
>     + Duration function is also not known  
>     + $c(\mathbf{x}):\mathcal{X} \to R^{+}$
>     + We can use the GP machinery to estimate $c()$ as well
>     + Combine the predicted objective cost and duration

## Parallelization

. . . 

> - if we are concerned with wallclock time, then a natural question is
>    + what $\mathbf{x}$ should be evaluated next, even while a set of points is being evaluated?  
>    + Ideally, we would do some planning (information state space search ala Gittins indices), but they are usually intractable  
>    + Snoek et al (2012) propose to compute MC estimates of the acquisition function under different possible results from pending function evaluations 
>    + With function like EI we can leverage Gaussian integration property

# Other applications of BO


## Tackling any other (C)MAB problem

- Ad placement: 
    - Placing an ad that has been shown to attract the most clicks (exploiting)
    - Or placing a different ad that we know less about, that might attract more clicks (exploring)

- Recommender system
    - People are interested in true exploration, not only seeing what other similar people have looked for  
    - In some setups, like news recommendation, choice sets are changing all the time, RL approach is more suitable

- Learning user preferences
    - Market research, finding an optimal combination of features in a new product  
    - E.g. tuning the recommender system so it is customized for each user
