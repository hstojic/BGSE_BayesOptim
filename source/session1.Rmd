# The roadmap


## The problem 

. . .

- What are the hyperparameters and how do we optimize them?

. . .

> - Some examples:  
>      + SVM: regularisation term C, kernel parameters  
>      + Logistic regression: SGD learning rate, regularization parameter, mini batch size, number of epochs  
>      + Online Latent Dirichlet Allocation: two learning rate parameters, mini batch size  
>      + Three-layer convolutional neural network: SGD learning rate, number of epochs, 4 x weight costs (layers and softmax), width, scale and power (the response normalization on the pooling layers)   

. . .

> - Standard procedures  
>      + Grid search  
>      + Random Search

. . .

- What are (dis)advantages of the usual approaches?

<!-- 
What are the hyperpars?
- parameters that govern the behavior of other parameters and/or determine their number

What is the issue with optimizing hyperpars?
- if they need an encouragement: say catgorization problem and model that can perfectly fit data, say kNN? how do you fit k?
- what did you do so far? 
- any kaggle competition?

Examples (from Snoek et al)
- SVM has a bit more than just C?
- Online LDA (Hoffman et al 2010) uses variational bayes
- this is a particular example, once you already set an architecture!

Disadvantages of the existing approaches?
- can be very costly! 
- training a complicated NN can last for days 
- we want to reduce the number of evaluations!

Advantages?
- embarrassingly parallel and user friendly
- trivial to submit 20*20*20 jobs to my cluster and just wait for them to finish
- psych, you are not losing a job, automated statistician...Somehow I need to believe that I'm not better than these algorithms at tuning hyperparameters
 
-->

## A closer look at the problem

> - What is the alternative?

> - Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) algorithms  
>     + We build a model of the optimization surface
>     + Make active choices where to sample next

> - Learning a model 
>     + We can leverage our supervised learning machinery  
>     + Probabilistic approaches more helpful

> - Active selection?  
>     + Involves balancing exploration and exploitation
>     + Strong interaction between the two processes  
>     + Calls for smart selection, probabilistic models make it easier 

> - When does it make sense?
>     + Optimizing SMBO can be a hard problem  
>     + Hence, when optimizing costly models, i.e. when time or number of evaluations is very valuable    

<!-- 

How do we go about this?
- anyone tried any of the alternatives? any ideas?

Decision making part complicates things significantly:
- choice affects how much you can learn from the observation
- what you know about the surface affects your choices
- this is probably why these algorithms have not been more popular

Arent we changing a hard optimization problem for an even harder one?
- This makes sense only if this optimization problem is less costly than the original training
- hence, we dont use it for models that are quick to train

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/manyfaces.png}

\source{\href{http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html}{David Silver lectures}}

<!-- 
Lot of different approaches
- terminology different
- different applications and solutions
- at the center is the optimal way to make decisions

Psychology probably the earliest
- Thurstone (1927)
- Thompson (1933)
- Statistics during WWII - Robbins?

-->
----


## Relation to other types of learning 

\center
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/relationtootherlearning.png}

\source{\href{http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html}{David Silver lectures}}

<!-- 
In some ways signal is stronger than in unsupervised and weaker than supervised.
- clear in classification case 
- you get what is a correct label i.e. information on counterfactual - all others are wrong
- while in reinforcement feedback does not contain the counterfactual information

But there are lots of other differences
- agents have to act, has the EETO, 
-->
----


## Main characteristics 

- Agent receives rewards   
    + There is no teaching signal  
    + Agent does not observe the counterfactual
    + Goal of the agent is to maximize rewards  

. . . 

- Agent has to take actions  
    + Exploration exploitation trade off  
    + Feedback is (potentially) delayed, credit assignment problem  
    + Sacrificing immediate reward to gain more later on
    + Actions (potentially) affect the subsequent data  
    + Sequential, non IID data 

. . . 

- Examples  
    + Robots, autonomous vehicles  
    + Managing investment portfolio  
    + Optimizing the data centres  

<!-- 
Example:
- robot moving through the world 
- when it moves one step what it can see changes, it affected the  observations it receives, actions it can take in that location  
- does it open door to a room? will it find the charging station or nasty kids that will hurt it

Sacrifising
- Blocking opponent moves (might help winning chances many moves from now)
- You studying now instead of working :)

Show RL playing Atari!!!
- the only framework that can do this
-->
----


## Reward hypothesis 

- Reward, $R_t$, is a **scalar** feedback signal   
    + Signals how well agent is doing at time $t$ 
    + Agent maximizes the long run sum of rewards  
    + Exogenously given  

. . . 

- Reward Hypothesis  
    + All goals can be described by the maximisation of expected cumulative reward

. . . 

- Examples  
    + Pain if you lose a body part, satisfaction from food  
    + Negative reward for moving in the gridworlds  
    + Positive/negative reward for increasing/decreasing score in Atari videogames  

<!-- 
- exogenously given
- think of it as being shaped by evolution
    - evo hard wired us to feel pain for certain events, bcs it reduces chances of survival, i.e. those that feel pain were surviving 
    - does not prevent evolution to hardwire reward from playing

- in AI we engineer it, e.g. in gridworlds it is useful to use -1 for each step

- why a scalar?
    - you need a ruler! regardless how different things are you need to compare them to make a decision
    - e.g. staying at work or meeting your girlfriend

Do you agree with this statement?
- you either buy it or not

-->
----


## Agent and environment

\center
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/agentenvironment.png}

\source{\href{http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html}{David Silver lectures}}

<!-- 
At each step t the agent:
- Executes action A t
- Receives observation O t
- Receives scalar reward R t

The environment:
- Receives action A t
- Emits observation O t+1
- Emits scalar reward R t+1

t increments at env. step

E is given, A can only influence it through actions 
- think of a fisherman in a lake

Even if there are other agents in the world, from agents perspective thats part of the environment, does not change the formalism.

-->
----


## History and State

. . . 

- **The history** is the sequence of observations, actions, rewards $$H_t = O_1, R_1, A_1, ..., A_{t-1}, O_t, R_t$$  
    + The agent selects action $A_t$ based on $H_t$  
    + The environment selects observations and rewards

. . . 

>  - **The state** is a summary information of the history, some function of it $$S_t = f(H_t)$$  
>      + The environment state $S_t^e$, private representation of $H_t$  
>          * Agents might or might not observe parts of it  
>          * E.g. this might be a true cost function of hyperparameters  
>      + The agent state $S_t^a$, internal representation  
>          * Important part, used by algorithms  
>          * E.g. agent might use hyperparameter values to estimate the cost function  
>          * Many choices, what to remember and what to throw away of $H_t$  
>          * E.g. estimate function in parametric way and keep parameters  

<!-- 

History contains EVERYTHING:
- i.e. all observable variables up to time t
- i.e. the sensorimotor stream of a robot or embodied agent

Issue - history can be huge!
- think of number of states in bacgammon, 10^20, go, 10^120

VIP - States
- It is ANY function of the history

Environment state
- whatever data the environment uses to pick the next observation/reward
- even if partially visible, it may contain irrelevant information
- not useful for building an agent!

Agents state
- the most important part, one we use in algos
- actually, often it is an engineering problem, how to represent information from the environment in a useful way 
    - E.g. pole balancing car, angle, velocity, location?

-->
----


## What is the agent's state? 

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/ratproblem.png}

. . . 

- Last 3 items in sequence?  

. . . 

- Counts for lights, bells and levers?  

. . . 

- Complete sequence?


<!-- 
All 3 are valid suggestions, perhaps rat needs to get more experience to figure it out
-->
----


## More about environments 

. . .     

> - A state $S_t$ is Markov if and only if $$P[S_{t+1}|S_t] = P[S_{t+1}|S_1, ..., S_t]$$  
>     + The future is independent of the past given the present  
>     + We have all the information necessary for making optimal choices  

> - Fully observable environment  
>     + Agent can observe environment state  $O_t = S_t^a = S_t^e$  
>     + This is a Markov decision process (MDP)

> - Partially observable environment (POMDP) 
>     + Agent can indirectly observe environment state  
>     + Using this info agent constructs the state 
>         * E.g. beliefs of environment state: $S_t^a = (P[S_t^e = s^1],..., P[S_t^e = s^n])$  
>     + E.g. in hyperparameter case, we partially observe environment state through hyperparameter values  
>     + E.g. investment agent observes prices, but not trends etc  



<!-- 
Markov 
- Once the state is known, the history may be thrown away
- i.e. The state is a sufficient statistic of the future
- The environment state S t e is Markov (but unknowable)
- The history H t is Markov (but impractical)

MDP 
- Atari agent observes what happens in the atari emulator  
- can use it to simulate everything and come up with the optimal solution


POMDP
- A robot with camera vision isn’t told its absolute location
- A trading agent only observes current prices
- A poker playing agent only observes public cards  
- Atari agent does not observe what happens in the atari emulator

Complete history: S t a = H t
Recurrent neural network: S t a = σ(S t−1 W s + O t W o )
-->
----


## Constructing the Agent 

. . . 

- **Policy**: 
    + Agent’s behaviour function  
    + Deterministic policy: $a = \pi(s)$
    + Stochastic policy: $\pi(a|s) = P[A_t = a|S_t = s]$

. . . 

- **Value function**:  
    + Agent uses it to predict future reward, determines how good is each state and/or action  
    + Used to select between actions  
    + $V_{\pi}(s) = E_{\pi}[R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + ... | S_t = s]$

. . . 

- **Model**: agent’s representation of the environment, predicts
    + What the environment will do next  
    + The next state: $\mathcal{P}_{ss'}^a = P[S_{t+1} = s'|S_t = s, A_t = a]$
    + The next reward: $\mathcal{R}_{s}^a = E[R_{t+1}|S_t = s, A_t = a]$

<!-- 

main components
- not an exhaustive list 
- not all required 

Policy 
- a map from state to action
- can be deterministic, if robot decides to move north, it moves north with probability 1
- stochastic, with some probability it moves in direction that was not intended
    - very useful for exploration

Value function
- note the infinite sum, finite with discount factor
- estimates the long-term reward of this state  
- one way to learn it, in restricted set of problems is through value iteration
  - dynamic programming
- note the dependence on policy, if you have a fixed RCM policy, its learning history will be different

Model:
- optional, agent can benefit by knowing it a bit
- gives transition probabilities
- we can use it to simulate what happens in the world and do planning
- can be learned 
-

## Exploration exploitation problem

- Acting involves a fundamental trade-off:  
    + **Exploitation**: Make the best decision given current information
    + **Exploration**: Gather more information  

. . . 

- The best long-term strategy may involve short-term sacrifices  

. . . 

- **Goal**: Gather enough information to make the best overall decisions  

. . .  

- Examples:  
    + Going to a favourite restaurant (**exploitation**), or try a new restaurant (**exploration**)  
    + Show the most successful ad (**exploitation**), or show a new ad (**exploration**)

<!-- 

Reinforcement learning is like trial-and-error learning
- The agent should discover a good policy
- From its experiences of the environment
- Without losing too much reward along the way

Lets return to the notion of decision making
- in focusing on it we will remove certain elements of RL
- MABs - no delayed rewards, dynamical system

Problem unique to RL
- arises when you need to act
- what are the main ingredients?
    - partial feedback 
    - stochastic output

I will not go into other problems in RL as they will not be relevant for us
- Learning vs Planning
    - Reinforcement Learning:
        The environment is initially unknown
        The agent interacts with the environment
        The agent improves its policy
    - Planning:
        A model of the environment is known
        The agent performs computations with its model (without any         external interaction)
        The agent improves its policy a.k.a. deliberation, reasoning, introspection, pondering, thought, search
- Prediction and Control
    - Prediction: evaluate the future
        - Given a policy
    - Control: optimise the future
        - Find the best policy
-->
----
 


## How can we try to solve it?

. . .

1. **Random exploration**  
    - Adding some noise to a greedy policy
    - Examples: $\epsilon$-greedy, Softmax

. . .

2. **Optimism in the face of uncertainty**  
    - Using all available information, estimate uncertainty on value 
    - Prefer to explore uncertain states/actions
    - Examples: Optimistic initialisation, Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson sampling, Expected Improvement, Probability of Improvement

. . . 

3. **Information state space search**  
    - Considering agent's information in its state space
    - Lookahead to determine how information helps in maximizing rewards
    - Examples: Gittins indices (see Whittle, 1980), tractable approximation with Bayesian Adaptive Monte Carlo Planning (Guez, Silver, Dayan, 2012; 2014)

<!-- 

draw on silvers 9th lecture

1. Can do well 
- actually fits people rather well (softmax)

2. optimism
- heuristics ultimately
- We need a measure of uncertainty! 
    - not easy to get, 
    - we need probabilistic treatment of the problem 
    - not always true, you can use counts as proxies in MAB (but not CMAB)
- in big space we might never stop exploring?
- sometimes we need safe exploration (robot example, or humans)

3. More optimal strategies  
- estimating the value of information (WTP for exploring, LR reward with info minus immediate reward w/o info)
- convert MAB problem into a MDP, where we have information states 
- say, number each arm has been pulled - now we can simulate what happens with each decision, how information state changes)
- we traverse the tree, and if we can solve the MDP we have an optimal solution
- BUT, usually intractable :)  
- better for a fixed budget
- we will not cover these
    - first, I'm not an expert
    - second, computationally very expensive, and we need fast evaluation otherwise we get a harder problem than training the function
    - still an approximation, optimal solutions for very narrow set of problems 
    - more relevant for dynamical systems where state changes upon action, and we have delayed rewards
-  Gittins indices are here 
   - truly optimal allocation, 
   - but restricted to narrow set of situations - Bernoulli bandits
   - bayes adaptive rl
